# Interview Notes — Week 6

## Participant A
**Date**: 2025-11-23
**Context**: Has ADHD, prefers dark mode
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: ~10 minutes

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager
**Response**: "I use a to-do list app as a widget on my phone, but it doesn't sort by anything or show times which stresses me out"

**Observations**:
- Lack of chronological sorting (not chronological)
- Doesn't show deadlines (deadline stress)

**Themes**: `cognitive_load`, `deadline_anxiety`

---

### Q2: What frustrates you?
**Response**: "When I accidentally check something off it completely deletes it, I can't undo it without recreating the task"

**Observations**:
- Lack of history/undo possibilities
- Doesn't show completed tasks

**Themes**: `no_history`, `confirmation`, `trust`

---

### Q3: Lost track of important task?
**Response**: "I once accidentally misclicked on a task making it disappear and then forgot about it until the day of - sometimes because of the order things will end up at the bottom and I don't see them either so I forget"

**Observations**:
- List length issue (visibility)
- Lack of confirmation when tasks checked off/completed
- Prioritisation need
- Consequence = missed deadline (high impact)

**Themes**: `prioritisation`, `visibility`, `confirmation`, `urgent_tasks`

---



### Q4: Do you ever work without a mouse (trackpad broken, on train)? How does that change how you interact with apps?
**Response**: "I mostly do things on my phone, but when my mouse is out of charge, I have to use my keyboard to navigate websites - sometimes it skips parts of the page so I can't really do what I need to"

**Observations**:
- Keyboard-only navigation impossible
- Temporary impairment (lack of hardware available)
- Exclusion from features

**Themes**: `temporary_impairment`, `element_accessibility`, `keyboard_nav`

### Q5: Have you used a task manager with your eyes closed or in bright sunlight? What was hard??
**Response**: "I've never used one with my eyes closed, but I struggle with sensitivity to light, and often when I open my phone the widget shows up in light mode, which strains my eyes and I can't read the list because of the low contrast."

**Observations**:
- Contrast issue (readability)
- Eye strain from brightness

**Themes**: `contrast`, `brightness`, `eye_strain`

---

### Q6: One feature to add?
**Response**: "A way to add deadlines with a progress bar so I can clearly see how long a task has left"

**Observations**:
- Motivation through feedback
- Progress visualisation

**Themes**: `progress_tracking`, `visualisation`, `feedback`

---

## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1. Lack of chronology -> cognitive overload
2. No confirmation/verification -> uncertainty
3. Contrast issues in bright light -> situational disability
4. Keyboard navigation skipping elements -> temporary exclusion

**Job story ideas**:
- "When I'm sorting tasks, I want the order to be chronological so I know what is urgent"
- "When I submit a form, I want to be able to undo my actions so I don't accidentally undo important work"
- "When my mouse isn't charged, I want to be able to navigate the page fully with my keyboard"


## Participant B
**Date**: 2025-11-23
**Context**: Deuteranope colourblindness
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: ~10 minutes

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager
**Response**: "I use notion on my laptop to keep track of uni work, but it has a bit of a steep learning curve to begin with, which means I'm not really motivated to use it - sometimes the info isn't immediately very clear"

**Observations**:
- Not obvious how to use (ease of access)
- Lack of motivation

**Themes**: `ease_of_access`, `motivation`, `clarity`

---

### Q2: What frustrates you?
**Response**: "By default, when you make a task different priorities or categories, it shows by colour, and I can't tell the difference between some categories. It colours the actual text, not like a highlight either"

**Observations**:
- Colour differentiation issue (situational disability)
- Unclear what priority of tasks is, no alternative
- Exclusion from features

**Themes**: `visibility`, `prioritisation`, `colour_accessibility`

---

### Q3: Lost track of important task?
**Response**: "The tasks are sorted by the order you put them in, so they don't come up in order of need for completion - sometimes if my list is too long I'll just forget about ones that I put in originally. I've put in a task late 'cos of that."

**Observations**:
- List too long
- Prioritisation need
- Different sorting types ideal
- Missed deadline as consequence (big problem)

**Themes**: `prioritisation`, `visibility`, `urgent_tasks`, `chronological`

---

### Q4: Do you ever work without a mouse (trackpad broken, on train)? How does that change how you interact with apps?
**Response**: "My trackpad doesn't work on my laptop, and when I'm on the train commuting to uni I don't have space for a mouse, so I use my keyboard. Once I'm typing in a text field, it doesn't let me get out of it without closing the app to tab to the next buttons."

**Observations**:
- User gets stuck using only keyboard
- Temporary impairment (broken hardware, lack of space)
- App becomes completely inaccessible via text fields, exclusion from entire app (severe)

**Themes**: `temporary_impairment`, `keyboard_navigation`, `total_exclusion`

### Q5: Have you used a task manager with your eyes closed or in bright sunlight? What was hard??
**Response**: "I have used notion in bright sunlight, and it is even harder to tell between colours because of the lack of contrast. Never closed my eyes for it though."

**Observations**:
- Lack of contrast (colour differentiation)

**Themes**: `colour_accessibility`, `contrast`

---

### Q6: One feature to add?
**Response**: "I'd like them to add a way to keep track of progress within a task, like a to-do list in the task or a progress bar"

**Observations**:
- Progress visualisation
- Motivation through feedback
- Clear goal-oriented tracking

**Themes**: `goal_oriented`, `feedback`, `motivation`

---

## Summary (Participant B)
**Top pain points**:
1. Colour-focussed design -> inaccessible features
2. Lack of chronology -> unclear goals
3. Keyboard navigation getting stuck -> total situational exclusion

**Job story ideas**:
- "When I'm sorting tasks, I want the order to be chronological so I know what is urgent"
- "When I categorise a task, I want to be able to see this without relying on colours"
- "When my trackpad is broken and I don't have space for a mouse, I want to be able to navigate fully with my keyboard"
